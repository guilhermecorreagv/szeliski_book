# Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, 2nd ed. Unofficial Book Solution

To start my journey in computer vision I decided to tackle one of the best books in the field, and to solidify this knowledge I will try to solve all the questions on the book.

As an exercise by a learning student, I cannot guarantee the correctness of all the solutions provided here.

Each folder contains a chapter, in addition to the exercises I might eventually implement some small projects related to the chapter.
